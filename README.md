# Flights - Eurostat Explorative Information Visualization

The goal of this project is to provide an easy to use tool to visualize and compare the reach of commercial aviation through the years and for different airports. A fully static webpage is provided, which can be expanded in many ways. Data for 31 of the most significant airports in Spain is showcased.

Python scripts were used to parse and adapt the data. These Python scripts are provided "as is".
